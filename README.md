# Docker Setup

Clone to project directory and rename to `docker` from `dockerize`. Then move `.dockerignore` and `docker-compose.yml` files from docker directory to root folder (project directory).

#### Note:
If you did not rename the repo to `docker` or you changed it to another name, then you have to make changes to `docker-compose.yml` files to point to the correct path.
